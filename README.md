## Description

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. 

A CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It is deployed using  Heroku. This app uses a MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation
This app requires a functioning browser in order to run correctly.

 ## Usage 
This app has get, post, update, and delete routes using express. A blogger can create a post, update that post, and delete that post. A user can also comment on a post, but they are not allowed to update or delete their comments. A user must also be logged in to their account in order to access certain parts of this application which is checked by a helper function embedded into the routing functions.
